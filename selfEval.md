# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?

I feel that I have pretty good time management but at times I do go down rabbit holes of things I dont understand and it takes up a lot of time. making assignements the first priority is so important. 

- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?
a function is a way you can make your own rules, you can say how would you eat this cookie?, make them tell you the steps and then after they are finished you can tell them now if you want to eat this cookie again you can make a rule called eatCookie, when you say this I know how to eat the cookie because the steps are in the rule eatCookie. (haha I tried)

- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters. The parameters is how we declare a function to become one variable or more which we can later use argumentsin the function to call it and test the data. 

- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to being to your Small Group?
can we use 'for statements and arrays inside of functions? If we can how would that look like syntax wise?
